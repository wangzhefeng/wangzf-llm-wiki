Today we are doing a walkthrough of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE).

## Introduction

RoPE was introduced in the paper " [RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) " and has become an important technique in modern transformer architectures. The fundamental idea is elegant: encode positional information directly into the token representations by performing rotations in the feature space.

## Mathematical Foundation

At its core, RoPE works by organizing features into pairs and treating each pair as coordinates in a 2D plane. It then applies a rotation to these coordinates, with the angle of rotation depending on the position of the token in the sequence.

### Single Pair Rotation

For a single pair of features $x^{(1)}_m$ and $x^{(2)}_m$ at position $m$, the rotation is defined as:

  
$$
RoPE(x^{(1)}_m, x^{(2)}_m, m) =
\begin{pmatrix} \cos m\theta & -\sin m\theta
\\
\sin m\theta & \cos m\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x^{(1)}_m \\ x^{(2)}_m \end{pmatrix}
$$

When we multiply these matrices, we get:

  
$$
\begin{pmatrix} x^{(1)}_m \cos m\theta - x^{(2)}_m \sin m\theta
\\
x^{(2)}_m \cos m\theta + x^{(1)}_m \sin m\theta \end{pmatrix}
$$

This is a standard rotation matrix that rotates the vector $(x^{(1)}_m, x^{(2)}_m)$ by an angle of $m\theta$ in the 2D plane.

### Relative Position Property

One of the most significant properties of RoPE is that it naturally encodes relative positional information. Let's see how this works mathematically.

When we compute the dot product between two position-encoded vectors at positions $m$ and $n$, we get:

$\langle RoPE(x^{(1)}_m, x^{(2)}_m, m), RoPE(x^{(1)}_n, x^{(2)}_n, n) \rangle =$  
$(x^{(1)}_m \cos m\theta - x^{(2)}_m \sin m \theta)(x^{(1)}_n \cos n\theta - x^{(2)}_n \sin n \theta) +$  
$(x^{(2)}_m \cos m\theta + x^{(1)}_m \sin m \theta)(x^{(2)}_n \cos n\theta + x^{(1)}_n \sin n \theta)$

Through trigonometric identities, this expands to:

$x^{(1)}_m x^{(1)}_n \cos(m-n)\theta + x^{(1)}_m x^{(2)}_n \sin(m-n)\theta -$  
$x^{(2)}_m x^{(1)}_n \sin(m-n)\theta + x^{(2)}_m x^{(2)}_n \cos(m-n)\theta$

This can be rewritten as:

$(x^{(1)}_m \cos(m-n)\theta - x^{(2)}_m \sin(m-n)\theta)x^{(1)}_n +$  
$(x^{(2)}_m \cos(m-n)\theta + x^{(1)}_m \sin(m-n)\theta)x^{(2)}_n$

Which is equivalent to:

$$
\langle RoPE(x^{(1)}_m, x^{(2)}_m, m-n), RoPE(x^{(1)}_n, x^{(2)}_n, 0) \rangle
$$

This means the dot product depends only on the relative position $(m-n)$, not on the absolute positions. This property is crucial for attention mechanisms, as it allows the model to focus on how tokens relate to each other rather than their absolute positions in the sequence.

### Multiple Feature Pairs

In practice, we have many features, not just two. The RoPE method pairs the features and applies different rotation angles to each pair. If we have $d$ features, we create $\frac{d}{2}$ pairs.

For the angle $\theta_i$ used for the $i$ -th pair, the paper suggests:

$$
\theta_i = 10000^{-\frac{2(i-1)}{d}}, i \in [1, 2, ..., \frac{d}{2}]
$$

This formula creates a sequence of angles that decrease geometrically, allowing the model to capture patterns at different scales.

## Coding RoPE

Now, let's dive deep into the implementation code.

### The RotaryPositionalEmbeddings Class

```python
class RotaryPositionalEmbeddings(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d: int, base: int = 10_000):
        """
        * d is the number of features
        * base is the constant used for calculating θ
        """
        super().__init__()

        self.base = base
        self.d = d
        self.cos_cached = None
        self.sin_cached = None
```

constructor takes two parameters:

- `d`: The number of features to which rotary embeddings will be applied
- `base`: The base for calculating the frequency of rotations (default 10,000)

this also initializes two cache variables (`cos_cached` and `sin_cached`) to store precomputed trigonometric values for efficiency.

### Building the Cache

```python
def _build_cache(self, x: torch.Tensor):
    """
    Cache cosine and sine values for rotary embeddings.
    """

    # If cache already exists and is sufficient for the input, return early
    if self.cos_cached is not None and x.shape[0] <= self.cos_cached.shape[0]:
        return

    # Get the sequence length from the input tensor
    seq_len = x.shape[0]

    # Compute the inverse frequency vector:
    # theta = [10000^(-2i/d) for i in range(0, d, 2)]
    theta = 1. / (self.base ** (torch.arange(0, self.d, 2).float() / self.d)).to(x.device)

    # Create position indices: [0, 1, ..., seq_len - 1]
    seq_idx = torch.arange(seq_len, device=x.device).float()

    # Compute outer product of position indices and theta:
    # Resulting shape: (seq_len, d/2)
    idx_theta = torch.einsum('n,d->nd', seq_idx, theta)

    # Duplicate the idx_theta values to match dimensionality:
    # Each row m becomes:
    # [m*theta_0, m*theta_1, ..., m*theta_{d/2 - 1}, m*theta_0, ..., m*theta_{d/2 - 1}]
    idx_theta2 = torch.cat([idx_theta, idx_theta], dim=1)

    # Cache the cosine and sine values with shape (seq_len, 1, 1, d)
    self.cos_cached = idx_theta2.cos()[:, None, None, :]
    self.sin_cached = idx_theta2.sin()[:, None, None, :]
```

This method precomputes the sine and cosine values needed for rotations:

- It first checks if a cache already exists and is large enough for the current sequence length
- computes the $\theta$ values for each feature pair using the formula $\theta_i = 10000^{-\frac{2(i-1)}{d}}$
- creates a tensor of position indices from 0 to seq\_len-1
- calculates the product of each position with each $\theta$ value using Einstein summation
- duplicates the theta values (as we'll need them for both parts of each feature pair)
- computes the sine and cosine of these values and caches them with appropriate dimensions

cached values have shape `[seq_len, 1, 1, d]` to easily broadcast with tensors of shape `[seq_len, batch_size, n_heads, d]`.

### The \_neg\_half Helper Method

```python
def _neg_half(self, x: torch.Tensor):
    # Get half the hidden dimension
    d_2 = self.d // 2

    # Return: negated second half of last dimension, followed by the first half
    return torch.cat([-x[:, :, :, d_2:], x[:, :, :, :d_2]], dim=-1)
```

the helper method prepares the tensor for the rotation operation. It:

- splits the tensor into two halves along the feature dimension
- negates the second half
- swaps the two halves and concatenates them

this is needed to implement the rotation formulas in an efficient vectorized manner.

### The Forward Pass

```python
def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor):
    """
    Apply rotary positional embeddings to the first \`d\` dimensions of \`x\`.

    Args:
        x (Tensor): Input tensor of shape [seq_len, batch_size, n_heads, dim]
    """
    # Cache cosine and sine values for rotary embeddings
    self._build_cache(x)

    # Split x into the part to apply rotary (first d dims) and the remaining features
    x_rope, x_pass = x[..., :self.d], x[..., self.d:]

    # Prepare the rotated (negated half) version of x_rope
    neg_half_x = self._neg_half(x_rope)

    # Apply rotary transformation using cached cos/sin values
    x_rope = (x_rope * self.cos_cached[:x.shape[0]]) + (neg_half_x * self.sin_cached[:x.shape[0]])

    # Concatenate the rotary-encoded part with the untouched remainder
    return torch.cat((x_rope, x_pass), dim=-1)
```

The forward method applies the rotary embeddings to the input tensor:

- ensures the cache is built by calling `_build_cache`
- splits the input tensor into two parts:
	- `x_rope`: The part to which rotary embeddings will be applied
		- `x_pass`: The part that will pass through unchanged
- applies the `_neg_half` transformation to prepare for the rotation
- performs the rotation by multiplying with the cached cosine and sine values
- concatenates the rotated features with the pass-through features

the implementation allows for applying RoPE to only a subset of the features if desired, which can be useful for efficiency or for combining with other types of positional encodings.

### Using RoPE in Multi-Head Attention

```python
class RotaryPEMultiHeadAttention(MultiHeadAttention):
    """
    ## Multi-head attention with rotary positional embeddings

    We override [multi-head attention from original transformer](../mha.html).
    """

    def __init__(self, heads: int, d_model: int, rope_percentage: float = 0.5, dropout_prob: float = 0.0):
        super().__init__(heads, d_model, dropout_prob)

        # Rotary positional embedding layers
        d_rope = int(self.d_k * rope_percentage)
        self.query_rotary_pe = RotaryPositionalEmbeddings(d_rope)
        self.key_rotary_pe = RotaryPositionalEmbeddings(d_rope)

    def get_scores(self, query: torch.Tensor, key: torch.Tensor):
        """
        ### Calculate scores between queries and keys
        """

        # Calculate dot-product with RoPE
        return torch.einsum('ibhd,jbhd->ijbh', self.query_rotary_pe(query), self.key_rotary_pe(key))
```

this extends a standard multi-head attention implementation to use RoPE:

- initializes two `RotaryPositionalEmbeddings` instances, one for queries and one for keys
- `rope_percentage` parameter controls what fraction of the features get rotary encodings
- in the `get_scores` method, it applies the rotary encodings to both queries and keys before computing their dot product
- The Einstein summation notation `'ibhd,jbhd->ijbh'` computes the attention scores, where:
	- `i`: Position index in the query sequence
		- `j`: Position index in the key sequence
		- `b`: Batch dimension
		- `h`: Head dimension
		- `d`: Feature dimension

### Testing the Implementation

```python
def _test_rotary():
    """
    Testing RoPE with a simple example
    """
    x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6, 7], [7, 8, 9, 10]], dtype=torch.float)
    x = x[:, None, None, :]
    inspect(x)

    rotary_pe = RotaryPositionalEmbeddings(4)
    inspect(rotary_pe(x))
```

the test function:

- creates a small tensor with 3 positions and 4 features
- reshapes it to have the expected dimensions `[seq_len, batch_size, n_heads, d]`
- applies rotary embeddings
- inspects both the input and output tensors

### Why Use RoPE?

RoPE offers several advantages over traditional positional encodings. By encoding relative positions directly into the attention mechanism, RoPE helps the model focus on how tokens relate to each other, which is often more important than their absolute positions in language understanding tasks. It has also been shown to extrapolate better to sequence lengths not seen during training, addressing a common issue with other positional encoding methods that struggle with longer sequences. The rotary encoding is specifically designed to work well with the dot-product attention mechanism, making it a natural fit for transformer architectures by seamlessly integrating positional information into the attention calculation process. The implementation is computationally efficient, especially with the caching mechanism shown in our code example, which allows for faster processing of long sequences by avoiding redundant trigonometric calculations. Additionally, the `rope_percentage` parameter provides flexibility by allowing RoPE to be applied to only a portion of the features, which can be useful for balancing positional information with other types of embeddings or information within the model.

Some subtle but important aspects of this implementation deserve attention. The caching of sine and cosine values significantly improves computational efficiency for long sequences by avoiding redundant calculations across multiple forward passes. The code implicitly pairs features using the `_neg_half` function, which cleverly rearranges the tensor to facilitate vectorized rotation operations across all feature pairs simultaneously. The implementation properly handles batch and head dimensions, making it fully compatible with standard transformer architectures where inputs have shape \[sequence\_length, batch\_size, n\_heads, feature\_dimension\]. Finally, the partial application capability—allowing RoPE to be applied to only a subset of features—is particularly useful when combining with other types of embeddings, enabling models to benefit from multiple forms of positional or contextual information simultaneously.

## RoPE

Rotary Positional Embeddings represent a sophisticated yet elegant approach to encoding positional information in transformer models. By leveraging rotations in the feature space, RoPE naturally captures relative positions, which is crucial for language understanding.

The implementation we've examined is both mathematically sound and computationally efficient, using caching and vectorized operations to perform the rotations efficiently. The integration with multi-head attention shows how this technique can be incorporated into a standard transformer architecture.

As we've seen in the mathematical analysis, RoPEs ability to encode relative positional information directly into the attention mechanism is its key strength, making it an important technique in modern NLP models, including many state-of-the-art large language models.

Understanding the details of RoPE, from the mathematical foundations to the implementation tricks and provides valuable insights into how modern transformer architectures handle positional information, a critical aspect of sequence modeling.
