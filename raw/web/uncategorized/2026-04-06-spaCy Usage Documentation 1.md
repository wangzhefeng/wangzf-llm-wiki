spaCy projects let you manage and share **end-to-end spaCy workflows** for different **use cases and domains**, and orchestrate training, packaging and serving your custom pipelines. You can start off by cloning a pre-defined project template, adjust it to fit your needs, load in your data, train a pipeline, export it as a Python package, upload your outputs to a remote storage and share your results with your team. spaCy projects can be used via the new [`spacy project`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project) command and we provide templates in our [`projects`](https://github.com/explosion/projects) repo.

Illustration of project workflow and commands

spaCy projects make it easy to integrate with many other **awesome tools** in the data science and machine learning ecosystem to track and manage your data and experiments, iterate on demos and prototypes and ship your models into production.

### 1\. Clone a project template

The [`spacy project clone`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-clone) command clones an existing project template and copies the files to a local directory. You can then run the project, e.g. to train a pipeline and edit the commands and scripts to build fully custom workflows.

```bash
python -m spacy project clone pipelines/tagger_parser_ud
```

By default, the project will be cloned into the current working directory. You can specify an optional second argument to define the output directory. The `--repo` option lets you define a custom repo to clone from if you don’t want to use the spaCy [`projects`](https://github.com/explosion/projects) repo. You can also use any private repo you have access to with Git.

### 2\. Fetch the project assets

Assets are data files your project needs – for example, the training and evaluation data or pretrained vectors and embeddings to initialize your model with. Each project template comes with a `project.yml` that defines the assets to download and where to put them. The [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#run) will fetch the project assets for you:

```bash
cd some_example_project
python -m spacy project assets
```

Asset URLs can be a number of different protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and even cloud storage such as GCS and S3. You can also fetch assets using git, by replacing the `url` string with a `git` block. spaCy will use Git’s “sparse checkout” feature to avoid downloading the whole repository.

Sometimes your project configuration may include large assets that you don’t necessarily want to download when you run `spacy project assets`. That’s why assets can be marked as [`extra`](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#data-assets-url) - by default, these assets are not downloaded. If they should be, run `spacy project assets --extra`.

### 3\. Run a command

Commands consist of one or more steps and can be run with [`spacy project run`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run). The following will run the command `preprocess` defined in the `project.yml`:

```bash
python -m spacy project run preprocess
```

Commands can define their expected [dependencies and outputs](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#deps-outputs) using the `deps` (files the commands require) and `outputs` (files the commands create) keys. This allows your project to track changes and determine whether a command needs to be re-run. For instance, if your input data changes, you want to re-run the `preprocess` command. But if nothing changed, this step can be skipped. You can also set `--force` to force re-running a command, or `--dry` to perform a “dry run” and see what would happen (without actually running the script).

Since spaCy v3.4.2, `spacy projects run` checks your installed dependencies to verify that your environment is properly set up and aligns with the project’s `requirements.txt`, if there is one. If missing or conflicting dependencies are detected, a corresponding warning is displayed. If you’d like to disable the dependency check, set `check_requirements: false` in your project’s `project.yml`.

### 4\. Run a workflow

Workflows are series of commands that are run in order and often depend on each other. For instance, to generate a pipeline package, you might start by converting your data, then run [`spacy train`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#train) to train your pipeline on the converted data and if that’s successful, run [`spacy package`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#package) to turn the best trained artifact into an installable Python package. The following command runs the workflow named `all` defined in the `project.yml`, and executes the commands it specifies, in order:

```bash
python -m spacy project run all
```

Using the expected [dependencies and outputs](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#deps-outputs) defined in the commands, spaCy can determine whether to re-run a command (if its inputs or outputs have changed) or whether to skip it. If you’re looking to implement more advanced data pipelines and track your changes in Git, check out the [Data Version Control (DVC) integration](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#dvc). The [`spacy project dvc`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-dvc) command generates a DVC config file from a workflow defined in your `project.yml` so you can manage your spaCy project as a DVC repo.

### 5\. Optional: Push to remote storage

After training a pipeline, you can optionally use the [`spacy project push`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-push) command to upload your outputs to a remote storage, using protocols like [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) or SSH. This can help you **export** your pipeline packages, **share** work with your team, or **cache results** to avoid repeating work.

```bash
python -m spacy project push
```

The `remotes` section in your `project.yml` lets you assign names to the different storages. To download state from a remote storage, you can use the [`spacy project pull`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-pull) command. For more details, see the docs on [remote storage](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#remote).

## Project directory and assets

### project.yml

The `project.yml` defines the assets a project depends on, like datasets and pretrained weights, as well as a series of commands that can be run separately or as a workflow – for instance, to preprocess the data, convert it to spaCy’s format, train a pipeline, evaluate it and export metrics, package it and spin up a quick web demo. It looks pretty similar to a config file used to define CI pipelines.

```yaml
explosion/projects/v3/pipelines/tagger_parser_ud/project.ymltitle: "Part-of-speech Tagging & Dependency Parsing (Universal Dependencies)"
description: >
  This project template lets you train a part-of-speech tagger,
  morphologizer, lemmatizer and dependency parser from a [Universal
  Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) corpus. It takes care of
  downloading the treebank, converting it to spaCy's format and training and
  evaluating the model. The template uses the
  [\`UD_English-EWT\`](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT)
  treebank by default, but you can swap it out for any other available
  treebank. Just make sure to adjust the \`lang\` and treebank settings in the
  variables below. Use \`xx\` for multi-language if no language-specific
  tokenizer is available in spaCy. Note that multi-word tokens will be merged
  together when the corpus is converted since spaCy does not support multi-word
  token expansion.

# Variables can be referenced across the project.yml using ${vars.var_name}

  config: "default"

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | An optional project title used in `--help` message and [auto-generated docs](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#custom-docs). |
| `description` | An optional project description used in [auto-generated docs](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#custom-docs). |
| `vars` | A dictionary of variables that can be referenced in paths, URLs and scripts and overridden on the CLI, just like [`config.cfg` variables](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config-interpolation). For example, `${vars.name}` will use the value of the variable `name`. Variables need to be defined in the section `vars`, but can be a nested dict, so you’re able to reference `${vars.model.name}`. |
| `env` | A dictionary of variables, mapped to the names of environment variables that will be read in when running the project. For example, `${env.name}` will use the value of the environment variable defined as `name`. |
| `directories` | An optional list of [directories](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#project-files) that should be created in the project for assets, training outputs, metrics etc. spaCy will make sure that these directories always exist. |
| `assets` | A list of assets that can be fetched with the [`project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets) command. `url` defines a URL or local path, `dest` is the destination file relative to the project directory, and an optional `checksum` ensures that an error is raised if the file’s checksum doesn’t match. Instead of `url`, you can also provide a `git` block with the keys `repo`, `branch` and `path`, to download from a Git repo. |
| `workflows` | A dictionary of workflow names, mapped to a list of command names, to execute in order. Workflows can be run with the [`project run`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run) command. |
| `commands` | A list of named commands. A command can define an optional help message (shown in the CLI when the user adds `--help`) and the `script`, a list of commands to run. The `deps` and `outputs` let you define the created file the command depends on and produces, respectively. This lets spaCy determine whether a command needs to be re-run because its dependencies or outputs changed. Commands can be run as part of a workflow, or separately with the [`project run`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run) command. |
| `spacy_version` | Optional spaCy version range like `>=3.0.0,<3.1.0` that the project is compatible with. If it’s loaded with an incompatible version, an error is raised when the project is loaded. |
| `check_requirements` v3.4.2 | A flag determining whether to verify that the installed dependencies align with the project’s `requirements.txt`. Defaults to `true`. |

### Data assets

Assets are any files that your project might need, like training and development corpora or pretrained weights for initializing your model. Assets are defined in the `assets` block of your `project.yml` and can be downloaded using the [`project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets) command. Defining checksums lets you verify that someone else running your project will use the same files you used. Asset URLs can be a number of different **protocols**: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and even **cloud storage** such as GCS and S3. You can also download assets from a **Git repo** instead.

#### Downloading from a URL or cloud storage

Under the hood, spaCy uses the [`smart-open`](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/smart_open) library so you can use any protocol it supports. Note that you may need to install extra dependencies to use certain protocols.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dest` | The destination path to save the downloaded asset to (relative to the project directory), including the file name. |
| `extra` | Optional flag determining whether this asset is downloaded only if `spacy project assets` is run with `--extra`. `False` by default. |
| `url` | The URL to download from, using the respective protocol. |
| `checksum` | Optional checksum of the file. If provided, it will be used to verify that the file matches and downloads will be skipped if a local file with the same checksum already exists. |
| `description` | Optional asset description, used in [auto-generated docs](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#custom-docs). |

#### Downloading from a Git repo

If a `git` block is provided, the asset is downloaded from the given Git repository. You can download from any repo that you have access to. Under the hood, this uses Git’s “sparse checkout” feature, so you’re only downloading the files you need and not the whole repo.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dest` | The destination path to save the downloaded asset to (relative to the project directory), including the file name. |
| `git` | `repo`: The URL of the repo to download from.   `path`: Path of the file or directory to download, relative to the repo root. "" specifies the root directory.   `branch`: The branch to download from. Defaults to `"master"`. |
| `checksum` | Optional checksum of the file. If provided, it will be used to verify that the file matches and downloads will be skipped if a local file with the same checksum already exists. |
| `description` | Optional asset description, used in [auto-generated docs](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#custom-docs). |

#### Working with private assets

For many projects, the datasets and weights you’re working with might be company-internal and not available over the internet. In that case, you can specify the destination paths and a checksum, and leave out the URL. When your teammates clone and run your project, they can place the files in the respective directory themselves. The [`project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets) command will alert you about missing files and mismatched checksums, so you can ensure that others are running your project with the same data.

### Dependencies and outputs

Each command defined in the `project.yml` can optionally define a list of dependencies and outputs. These are the files the command requires and creates. For example, a command for training a pipeline may depend on a [`config.cfg`](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config) and the training and evaluation data, and it will export a directory `model-best`, which you can then re-use in other commands.

```yaml
project.ymlcommands:
  - name: train
    help: 'Train a spaCy pipeline using the specified corpus and config'
    script:
      - 'python -m spacy train ./configs/config.cfg -o training/ --paths.train ./corpus/training.spacy --paths.dev ./corpus/evaluation.spacy'
    deps:
      - 'configs/config.cfg'
      - 'corpus/training.spacy'
      - 'corpus/evaluation.spacy'
    outputs:
      - 'training/model-best'
```

If you’re running a command and it depends on files that are missing, spaCy will show you an error. If a command defines dependencies and outputs that haven’t changed since the last run, the command will be skipped. This means that you’re only re-running commands if they need to be re-run. Commands can also set `no_skip: true` if they should never be skipped – for example commands that run tests. Commands without outputs are also never skipped. To force re-running a command or workflow, even if nothing changed, you can set the `--force` flag.

Note that [`spacy project`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project) doesn’t compile any dependency graphs based on the dependencies and outputs, and won’t re-run previous steps automatically. For instance, if you only run the command `train` that depends on data created by `preprocess` and those files are missing, spaCy will show an error – it won’t just re-run `preprocess`. If you’re looking for more advanced data management, check out the [Data Version Control (DVC) integration](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#dvc). If you’re planning on integrating your spaCy project with DVC, you can also use `outputs_no_cache` instead of `outputs` to define outputs that won’t be cached or tracked.

### Files and directory structure

The `project.yml` can define a list of `directories` that should be created within a project – for instance, `assets`, `training`, `corpus` and so on. spaCy will make sure that these directories are always available, so your commands can write to and read from them. Project directories will also include all files and directories copied from the project template with [`spacy project clone`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-clone). Here’s an example of a project directory:

```yaml
Example project directory├── project.yml          # the project settings
├── project.lock         # lockfile that tracks inputs/outputs
├── assets/              # downloaded data assets
├── configs/             # pipeline config.cfg files used for training
├── corpus/              # output directory for training corpus
├── metas/               # pipeline meta.json templates used for packaging
├── metrics/             # output directory for evaluation metrics
├── notebooks/           # directory for Jupyter notebooks
├── packages/            # output directory for pipeline Python packages
├── scripts/             # directory for scripts, e.g. referenced in commands
├── training/            # output directory for trained pipelines
└── ...                  # any other files, like a requirements.txt etc.
```

If you don’t want a project to create a directory, you can delete it and remove its entry from the `project.yml` – just make sure it’s not required by any of the commands. [Custom templates](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#custom) can use any directories they need – the only file that’s required for a project is the `project.yml`.

---

## Custom scripts and projects

The `project.yml` lets you define any custom commands and run them as part of your training, evaluation or deployment workflows. The `script` section defines a list of commands that are called in a subprocess, in order. This lets you execute other Python scripts or command-line tools. Let’s say you’ve written a few integration tests that load the best model produced by the training command and check that it works correctly. You can now define a `test` command that calls into [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), runs your tests and uses [`pytest-html`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-html) to export a test report:

```yaml
project.ymlcommands:
  - name: test
    help: 'Test the trained pipeline'
    script:
      - 'pip install pytest pytest-html'
      - 'python -m pytest ./scripts/tests --html=metrics/test-report.html'
    deps:
      - 'training/model-best'
    outputs:
      - 'metrics/test-report.html'
    no_skip: true
```

Adding `training/model-best` to the command’s `deps` lets you ensure that the file is available. If not, spaCy will show an error and the command won’t run. Setting `no_skip: true` means that the command will always run, even if the dependencies (the trained pipeline) haven’t changed. This makes sense here, because you typically don’t want to skip your tests.

### Writing custom scripts

Your project commands can include any custom scripts – essentially, anything you can run from the command line. Here’s an example of a custom script that uses [`typer`](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) for quick and easy command-line arguments that you can define via your `project.yml`:

```python
scripts/custom_evaluation.pyimport typer

def custom_evaluation(batch_size: int = 128, model_path: str, data_path: str):
    # The arguments are now available as positional CLI arguments
    print(batch_size, model_path, data_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    typer.run(custom_evaluation)
```

In your `project.yml`, you can then run the script by calling `python scripts/custom_evaluation.py` with the function arguments. You can also use the `vars` section to define reusable variables that will be substituted in commands, paths and URLs. In this example, the batch size is defined as a variable will be added in place of `${vars.batch_size}` in the script. Just like in the [training config](https://spacy.io/usage/training##config-overrides), you can also override settings on the command line – for example using `--vars.batch_size`.

```yaml
project.ymlvars:
  batch_size: 128

commands:
  - name: evaluate
    script:
      - 'python scripts/custom_evaluation.py ${vars.batch_size} ./training/model-best ./corpus/eval.json'
    deps:
      - 'training/model-best'
      - 'corpus/eval.json'
```

You can also use the `env` section to reference **environment variables** and make their values available to the commands. This can be useful for overriding settings on the command line and passing through system-level settings.

```yaml
project.ymlenv:
  batch_size: BATCH_SIZE
  gpu_id: GPU_ID

commands:
  - name: evaluate
    script:
      - 'python scripts/custom_evaluation.py ${env.batch_size}'
```

### Documenting your project

When your custom project is ready and you want to share it with others, you can use the [`spacy project document`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-document) command to **auto-generate** a pretty, Markdown-formatted `README` file based on your project’s `project.yml`. It will list all commands, workflows and assets defined in the project and include details on how to run the project, as well as links to the relevant spaCy documentation to make it easy for others to get started using your project.

```bash
python -m spacy project document --output README.md
```

Under the hood, hidden markers are added to identify where the auto-generated content starts and ends. This means that you can add your own custom content before or after it and re-running the `project document` command will **only update the auto-generated part**. This makes it easy to keep your documentation up to date.

### Cloning from your own repo

The [`spacy project clone`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-clone) command lets you customize the repo to clone from using the `--repo` option. It calls into `git`, so you’ll be able to clone from any repo that you have access to, including private repos.

```bash
python -m spacy project clone your_project --repo https://github.com/you/repo
```

At a minimum, a valid project template needs to contain a [`project.yml`](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#project-yml). It can also include [other files](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#project-files), like custom scripts, a `requirements.txt` listing additional dependencies, [training configs](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config) and model meta templates, or Jupyter notebooks with usage examples.

## Remote Storage

You can persist your project outputs to a remote storage using the [`project push`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-push) command. This can help you **export** your pipeline packages, **share** work with your team, or **cache results** to avoid repeating work. The [`project pull`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-pull) command will download any outputs that are in the remote storage and aren’t available locally.

You can list one or more remotes in the `remotes` section of your [`project.yml`](https://spacy.io/usage/projects#project-yml) by mapping a string name to the URL of the storage. Under the hood, spaCy uses [`cloudpathlib`](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/) to communicate with the remote storages, so you can use any protocol that `cloudpathlib` supports, including [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), and the local filesystem, although you may need to install extra dependencies to use certain protocols.

```yaml
project.ymlremotes:
  default: 's3://my-spacy-bucket'
  local: '/mnt/scratch/cache'
```

For instance, let’s say you had the following command in your `project.yml`:

```yaml
project.yml- name: train
  help: 'Train a spaCy pipeline using the specified corpus and config'
  script:
    - 'spacy train ./config.cfg --output training/'
  deps:
    - 'corpus/train'
    - 'corpus/dev'
    - 'config.cfg'
  outputs:
    - 'training/model-best'
```

After you finish training, you run [`project push`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-push) to make sure the `training/model-best` output is saved to remote storage. spaCy will then construct a hash from your command script and the listed dependencies, `corpus/train`, `corpus/dev` and `config.cfg`, in order to identify the execution context of your output. It would then compute an MD5 hash of the `training/model-best` directory, and use those three pieces of information to construct the storage URL.

```bash
python -m spacy project run train
python -m spacy project push
```

If you change the command or one of its dependencies (for instance, by editing the [`config.cfg`](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config) file to tune the hyperparameters, a different creation hash will be calculated, so when you use [`project push`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-push) you won’t be overwriting your previous file. The system even supports multiple outputs for the same file and the same context, which can happen if your training process is not deterministic, or if you have dependencies that aren’t represented in the command.

In summary, the [`spacy project`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project) remote storages are designed to make a particular set of trade-offs. Priority is placed on **convenience**, **correctness** and **avoiding data loss**. You can use [`project push`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-push) freely, as you’ll never overwrite remote state, and you don’t have to come up with names or version numbers. However, it’s up to you to manage the size of your remote storage, and to remove files that are no longer relevant to you.

## Integrations

### Data Version Control (DVC)

Data assets like training corpora or pretrained weights are at the core of any NLP project, but they’re often difficult to manage: you can’t just check them into your Git repo to version and keep track of them. And if you have multiple steps that depend on each other, like a preprocessing step that generates your training data, you need to make sure the data is always up-to-date, and re-run all steps of your process every time, just to be safe.

[Data Version Control](https://dvc.org/) (DVC) is a standalone open-source tool that integrates into your workflow like Git, builds a dependency graph for your data pipelines and tracks and caches your data files. If you’re downloading data from an external source, like a storage bucket, DVC can tell whether the resource has changed. It can also determine whether to re-run a step, depending on whether its input have changed or not. All metadata can be checked into a Git repo, so you’ll always be able to reproduce your experiments.

To set up DVC, install the package and initialize your spaCy project as a Git and DVC repo. You can also [customize your DVC installation](https://dvc.org/doc/install/macos#install-with-pip) to include support for remote storage like Google Cloud Storage, S3, Azure, SSH and more.

```bash
pip install dvc   # Install DVC
git init          # Initialize a Git repo
dvc init          # Initialize a DVC project
```

The [`spacy project dvc`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-dvc) command creates a `dvc.yaml` config file based on a workflow defined in your `project.yml`. Whenever you update your project, you can re-run the command to update your DVC config. You can then manage your spaCy project like any other DVC project, run [`dvc add`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/add) to add and track assets and [`dvc repro`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/repro) to reproduce the workflow or individual commands.

```bash
python -m spacy project dvc project_dir workflow_name
```

### Prodigy

[Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) is a modern annotation tool for creating training data for machine learning models, developed by us. It integrates with spaCy out-of-the-box and provides many different [annotation recipes](https://prodi.gy/docs/recipes) for a variety of NLP tasks, with and without a model in the loop. If Prodigy is installed in your project, you can start the annotation server from your `project.yml` for a tight feedback loop between data development and training.

The following example shows a workflow for merging and exporting NER annotations collected with Prodigy and training a spaCy pipeline:

```yaml
project.ymlvars:
  prodigy:
    train_dataset: "fashion_brands_training"
    eval_dataset: "fashion_brands_eval"

workflows:
  all:
    - data-to-spacy
    - train_spacy

commands:
  - name: "data-to-spacy"
    help: "Merge your annotations and create data in spaCy's binary format"
    script:
      - "python -m prodigy data-to-spacy corpus/ --ner ${vars.prodigy.train_dataset},eval:${vars.prodigy.eval_dataset}"
    outputs:
      - "corpus/train.spacy"
      - "corpus/dev.spacy"
  - name: "train_spacy"
    help: "Train a named entity recognition model with spaCy"
    script:
      - "python -m spacy train configs/config.cfg --output training/ --paths.train corpus/train.spacy --paths.dev corpus/dev.spacy"
    deps:
      - "corpus/train.spacy"
      - "corpus/dev.spacy"
    outputs:
      - "training/model-best"
```

The [`train-curve`](https://prodi.gy/docs/recipes#train-curve) recipe is another cool workflow you can include in your project. It will run the training with different portions of the data, e.g. 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. As a rule of thumb, if accuracy increases in the last segment, this could indicate that collecting more annotations of the same type might improve the model further.

```yaml
project.yml (excerpt)- name: "train_curve"
    help: "Train the model with Prodigy by using different portions of training examples to evaluate if more annotations can potentially improve the performance"
    script:
      - "python -m prodigy train-curve --ner ${vars.prodigy.train_dataset},eval:${vars.prodigy.eval_dataset} --config configs/${vars.config} --show-plot"
```

You can use the same approach for various types of projects and annotation workflows, including [named entity recognition](https://prodi.gy/docs/named-entity-recognition), [span categorization](https://prodi.gy/docs/span-categorization), [text classification](https://prodi.gy/docs/text-classification), [dependency parsing](https://prodi.gy/docs/dependencies-relations), [part-of-speech tagging](https://prodi.gy/docs/recipes#pos) or fully [custom recipes](https://prodi.gy/docs/custom-recipes). You can also use spaCy project templates to quickly start the annotation server to collect more annotations and add them to your Prodigy dataset.

### Streamlit

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a Python framework for building interactive data apps. The [`spacy-streamlit`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-streamlit) package helps you integrate spaCy visualizations into your Streamlit apps and quickly spin up demos to explore your pipelines interactively. It includes a full embedded visualizer, as well as individual components.

![[spacy-streamlit 1.png|Screenshot of the spacy-streamlit package in Streamlit]]

Screenshot of the spacy-streamlit package in Streamlit

Using [`spacy-streamlit`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-streamlit), your projects can easily define their own scripts that spin up an interactive visualizer, using the latest pipeline you trained, or a selection of pipelines so you can compare their results.

```yaml
project.ymlcommands:
  - name: visualize
    help: "Visualize the pipeline's output interactively using Streamlit"
    script:
      - 'streamlit run ./scripts/visualize.py ./training/model-best "I like Adidas shoes."'
    deps:
      - "training/model-best"
```

The following script is called from the `project.yml` and takes two positional command-line argument: a comma-separated list of paths or packages to load the pipelines from and an example text to use as the default text.

```python
explosion/projects/v3/integrations/streamlit/scripts/visualize.pyimport spacy_streamlit
import typer

def main(models: str, default_text: str):
    models = [name.strip() for name in models.split(",")]
    spacy_streamlit.visualize(models, default_text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        typer.run(main)
    except SystemExit:
        pass
```

### FastAPI

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern high-performance framework for building REST APIs with Python, based on Python [type hints](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/). It’s become a popular library for serving machine learning models and you can use it in your spaCy projects to quickly serve up a trained pipeline and make it available behind a REST API.

```yaml
project.yml  - name: "serve"
    help: "Serve the models via a FastAPI REST API using the given host and port"
    script:
      - "uvicorn scripts.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000"
    deps:
      - "scripts/main.py"
    no_skip: true
```

The script included in the template shows a simple REST API with a `POST` endpoint that accepts batches of texts and returns batches of predictions, e.g. named entities found in the documents. Type hints and [`pydantic`](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic) are used to define the expected data types.

```python
explosion/projects/v3/integrations/fastapi/scripts/main.pyfrom typing import List, Dict, Any
from enum import Enum
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from pydantic import BaseModel
import spacy
from spacy.tokens import Doc

class ModelName(str, Enum):
    # Enum of the available models. This allows the API to raise a more specific
    # error if an invalid model is provided.
    en_core_web_sm = "en_core_web_sm"
    en_core_web_md = "en_core_web_md"
    en_core_web_lg = "en_core_web_lg"
    en_core_web_trf = "en_core_web_trf"

DEFAULT_MODEL = ModelName.en_core_web_sm
MODEL_NAMES = [model.value for model in ModelName]
MODELS = {name: spacy.load(name) for name in MODEL_NAMES}
print(f"Loaded {len(MODEL_NAMES)} models: {MODEL_NAMES}")

class Article(BaseModel):
    # Schema for a single article in a batch of articles to process
    text: str

class RequestModel(BaseModel):
    articles: List[Article]
    model: ModelName = DEFAULT_MODEL

class ResponseModel(BaseModel):
    # This is the schema of the expected response and depends on what you
    # return from get_data.

    class Batch(BaseModel):
        class Entity(BaseModel):
            label: str
            start: int
            end: int

        text: str
        ents: List[Entity] = []

    result: List[Batch]

def get_data(doc: Doc) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Extract the data to return from the REST API given a Doc object. Modify
    this function to include other data."""
    ents = [
        {
            "text": ent.text,
            "label": ent.label_,
            "start": ent.start_char,
            "end": ent.end_char,
        }
        for ent in doc.ents
    ]
    return {"text": doc.text, "ents": ents}

# Set up the FastAPI app and define the endpoints
app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=["*"])

@app.get("/models", summary="List all loaded models")
def get_models() -> List[str]:
    """Return a list of all available loaded models."""
    return MODEL_NAMES

@app.post("/process/", summary="Process batches of text", response_model=ResponseModel)
def process_articles(query: RequestModel):
    """Process a batch of articles and return the entities predicted by the
    given model. Each record in the data should have a key "text".
    """
    nlp = MODELS[query.model]
    response_body = []
    texts = (article.text for article in query.articles)
    for doc in nlp.pipe(texts):
        response_body.append(get_data(doc))
    return {"result": response_body}
```

### Weights & Biases

[Weights & Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) is a popular platform for experiment tracking. spaCy integrates with it out-of-the-box via the [`WandbLogger`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-loggers#wandblogger), which you can add as the `[training.logger]` block of your training [config](https://spacy.io/usage/training#config). The results of each step are then logged in your project, together with the full **training config**. This means that *every* hyperparameter, registered function name and argument will be tracked and you’ll be able to see the impact it has on your results.

### Hugging Face Hub

The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/) lets you upload models and share them with others. It hosts models as Git-based repositories which are storage spaces that can contain all your files. It support versioning, branches and custom metadata out-of-the-box, and provides browser-based visualizers for exploring your models interactively, as well as an API for production use. The [`spacy-huggingface-hub`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-huggingface-hub) package automatically adds the `huggingface-hub` command to your `spacy` CLI if it’s installed.

You can then upload any pipeline packaged with [`spacy package`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#package). Make sure to set `--build wheel` to output a binary `.whl` file. The uploader will read all metadata from the pipeline package, including the auto-generated pretty `README.md` and the model details available in the `meta.json`. For examples, check out the [spaCy pipelines](https://huggingface.co/spacy) we’ve uploaded.

```bash
huggingface-cli login
python -m spacy package ./en_ner_fashion ./output --build wheel
cd ./output/en_ner_fashion-0.0.0/dist
python -m spacy huggingface-hub push en_ner_fashion-0.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

After uploading, you will see the live URL of your pipeline packages, as well as the direct URL to the model wheel you can install via `pip install`. You’ll also be able to test your pipeline interactively from your browser:

![[huggingface_hub.jpg|Screenshot: interactive NER visualizer]]

Screenshot: interactive NER visualizer

In your `project.yml`, you can add a command that uploads your trained and packaged pipeline to the hub. You can either run this as a manual step, or automatically as part of a workflow. Make sure to set `--build wheel` when running `spacy package` to build a wheel file for your pipeline package.

```yaml
project.yml- name: "push_to_hub"
  help: "Upload the trained model to the Hugging Face Hub"
  script:
    - "python -m spacy huggingface-hub push packages/en_${vars.name}-${vars.version}/dist/en_${vars.name}-${vars.version}-py3-none-any.whl"
  deps:
    - "packages/en_${vars.name}-${vars.version}/dist/en_${vars.name}-${vars.version}-py3-none-any.whl"
```
