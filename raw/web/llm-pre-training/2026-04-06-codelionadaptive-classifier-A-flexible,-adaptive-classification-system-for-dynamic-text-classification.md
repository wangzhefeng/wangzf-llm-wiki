)

# Multi-label training data (each text can have multiple labels)
texts = [
    "AI researchers study climate change using machine learning",
    "Tech startup develops healthcare solutions"
]
labels = [
    ["technology", "science", "climate", "ai"],
    ["technology", "business", "healthcare"]
]

classifier.add_examples(texts, labels)

# Make multi-label predictions
predictions = classifier.predict_multilabel("Medical AI breakthrough announced")
# Output: [('healthcare', 0.72), ('technology', 0.68), ('ai', 0.45)]
```

### 💾 Save & Load Models

```
# Save locally
classifier.save("./my_classifier")
loaded_classifier = AdaptiveClassifier.load("./my_classifier")

# 🤗 HuggingFace Hub Integration
classifier.push_to_hub("adaptive-classifier/my-model")
hub_classifier = AdaptiveClassifier.from_pretrained("adaptive-classifier/my-model")
```

### 🎮 Strategic Defense (Anti-Gaming)

```
# Enable strategic classification for adversarial robustness
config = {'enable_strategic_mode': True}
strategic_classifier = AdaptiveClassifier("bert-base-uncased", config=config)

# Robust predictions against manipulation

# Returns predictions that consider potential gaming attempts
```

### ⚡ Optimized CPU Inference with ONNX

Adaptive Classifier includes **built-in ONNX Runtime support** for **2-4x faster CPU inference** with zero code changes required.

#### Automatic Optimization (Default)

ONNX Runtime is automatically used on CPU for optimal performance:

```
# Automatically uses ONNX on CPU, PyTorch on GPU
classifier = AdaptiveClassifier("bert-base-uncased")

# That's it! Predictions are 2-4x faster on CPU
predictions = classifier.predict("Fast inference!")
```

#### Performance Comparison

| Configuration | Speed | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PyTorch (GPU) | Fastest | GPU servers |
| **ONNX (CPU)** | **2-4x faster** | **Production CPU deployments** |
| PyTorch (CPU) | Baseline | Development, training |

#### Save & Deploy with ONNX

```
# Save with ONNX export (both quantized & unquantized versions)
classifier.save("./model")

# Push to Hub with ONNX (both versions included by default)
classifier.push_to_hub("username/model")

# Load automatically uses quantized ONNX on CPU (fastest, 4x smaller)
fast_classifier = AdaptiveClassifier.load("./model")

# Choose unquantized ONNX for maximum accuracy
accurate_classifier = AdaptiveClassifier.load("./model", prefer_quantized=False)

# Force PyTorch (no ONNX)
pytorch_classifier = AdaptiveClassifier.load("./model", use_onnx=False)

# Opt-out of ONNX export when saving
classifier.save("./model", include_onnx=False)
```

**ONNX Model Versions:**

- **Quantized (default)**: INT8 quantized, 4x smaller, ~1.14x faster on ARM, 2-4x faster on x86
- **Unquantized**: Full precision, maximum accuracy, larger file size

By default, models are saved with both versions, and the quantized version is automatically loaded for best performance. Use `prefer_quantized=False` if you need maximum accuracy.

#### Benchmark Your Model

```
# Compare PyTorch vs ONNX performance
python scripts/benchmark_onnx.py --model bert-base-uncased --runs 100
```

**Example Results:**

```
Model: bert-base-uncased (CPU)
PyTorch:  8.3ms/query  (baseline)
ONNX:     2.1ms/query  (4.0x faster) ✓
```

> **Note:** ONNX optimization is included by default. For GPU inference, PyTorch is automatically used for best performance.

## Advanced Usage

### Adding New Classes Dynamically

```
# Add a completely new class
new_texts = [
    "Error code 404 appeared",
    "System crashed after update"
]
new_labels = ["technical"] * 2

classifier.add_examples(new_texts, new_labels)
```

more_examples = [
    "Best purchase ever!",
    "Highly recommend this"
]
more_labels = ["positive"] * 2

classifier.add_examples(more_examples, more_labels)
```

### Multi-Label Classification with Advanced Configuration

```
from adaptive_classifier import MultiLabelAdaptiveClassifier

# Configure advanced multi-label settings
classifier = MultiLabelAdaptiveClassifier(
    "bert-base-uncased",
    default_threshold=0.5,      # Base threshold for predictions
    min_predictions=1,          # Minimum labels to return
    max_predictions=10          # Maximum labels to return
)

# Training with diverse multi-label examples
texts = [
    "Scientists develop AI for medical diagnosis and climate research",
    "Tech company launches sustainable energy and healthcare products",
    "Olympic athletes use sports science and nutrition technology"
]
labels = [
    ["science", "ai", "healthcare", "research"],
    ["technology", "business", "environment", "healthcare"],
    ["sports", "science", "health", "technology"]
]

classifier.add_examples(texts, labels)

# Advanced prediction options
predictions = classifier.predict_multilabel(
    "New research on AI applications in environmental science",
    threshold=0.3,     # Custom threshold
    max_labels=5       # Limit results
)

# Get detailed statistics
stats = classifier.get_label_statistics()
print(f"Adaptive threshold: {stats['adaptive_threshold']}")
print(f"Label-specific thresholds: {stats['label_thresholds']}")
```

### Strategic Classification (Anti-Gaming)

```
# Enable strategic mode to defend against adversarial inputs
config = {
    'enable_strategic_mode': True,
    'cost_function_type': 'linear',
    'cost_coefficients': {
        'sentiment_words': 0.5,    # Cost to change sentiment-bearing words
        'length_change': 0.1,      # Cost to modify text length
        'word_substitution': 0.3   # Cost to substitute words
    },
    'strategic_blend_regular_weight': 0.6,   # Weight for regular predictions
    'strategic_blend_strategic_weight': 0.4  # Weight for strategic predictions
}

classifier = AdaptiveClassifier("bert-base-uncased", config=config)
classifier.add_examples(texts, labels)

# Robust predictions that consider potential manipulation
text = "This product has amazing quality features!"

# Dual prediction (automatic blend of regular + strategic)
predictions = classifier.predict(text)

# Pure strategic prediction (simulates adversarial manipulation)
strategic_preds = classifier.predict_strategic(text)

# Robust prediction (assumes input may already be manipulated)
robust_preds = classifier.predict_robust(text)

print(f"Dual: {predictions}")
print(f"Strategic: {strategic_preds}")
print(f"Robust: {robust_preds}")
```

## 🏷️ Multi-Label Classification

The `MultiLabelAdaptiveClassifier` extends adaptive classification to handle scenarios where each text can belong to multiple categories simultaneously. It automatically handles threshold adaptation for scenarios with many labels.

### Key Features

- **🎯 Automatic Threshold Adaptation**: Dynamically adjusts thresholds based on the number of labels to prevent empty predictions
- **📊 Sigmoid Activation**: Uses proper multi-label architecture with BCE loss instead of softmax
- **⚙️ Configurable Limits**: Set minimum and maximum number of predictions per input
- **📈 Label-Specific Thresholds**: Automatically adjusts thresholds based on label frequency
- **🔄 Incremental Learning**: Add new labels and examples without retraining from scratch

### Usage

```
from adaptive_classifier import MultiLabelAdaptiveClassifier

# Initialize with configuration
classifier = MultiLabelAdaptiveClassifier(
    "distilbert/distilbert-base-cased",
    default_threshold=0.5,
    min_predictions=1,
    max_predictions=5
)

# Multi-label training data
texts = [
    "Breaking: Scientists discover AI can help predict climate change patterns",
    "Tech giant announces breakthrough in quantum computing for healthcare",
    "Olympic committee adopts new sports technology for athlete performance"
]

labels = [
    ["science", "technology", "climate", "news"],
    ["technology", "healthcare", "quantum", "business"],
    ["sports", "technology", "performance", "news"]
]

# Train the classifier
classifier.add_examples(texts, labels)

# Make predictions
predictions = classifier.predict_multilabel(
    "Revolutionary medical AI system launched by tech startup"
)

# Results: [('technology', 0.85), ('healthcare', 0.72), ('business', 0.45)]
```

### Adaptive Thresholds

The classifier automatically adjusts prediction thresholds based on the number of labels:

| Number of Labels | Threshold | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2-4 labels | 0.5 (default) | Standard precision |
| 5-9 labels | 0.4 (20% lower) | Balanced recall |
| 10-19 labels | 0.3 (40% lower) | Better coverage |
| 20-29 labels | 0.2 (60% lower) | Prevents empty results |
| 30+ labels | 0.1 (80% lower) | Ensures predictions |

This solves the common "No labels met the threshold criteria" issue when dealing with many-label scenarios.

## 🏢 Enterprise Use Cases

### 🔍 Hallucination Detection

Detect when LLMs generate information not supported by provided context (51.54% F1, 80.68% recall):

```
detector = AdaptiveClassifier.from_pretrained("adaptive-classifier/llm-hallucination-detector")
context = "France is in Western Europe. Capital: Paris. Population: ~67 million."
response = "Paris is the capital. Population is 70 million."  # Contains hallucination

prediction = detector.predict(f"Context: {context}\nAnswer: {response}")
# Returns: [('HALLUCINATED', 0.72), ('NOT_HALLUCINATED', 0.28)]
```

### 🚦 Intelligent LLM Routing

Optimize costs by routing queries to appropriate model tiers (32.40% cost savings):

```
router = AdaptiveClassifier.from_pretrained("adaptive-classifier/llm-router")
query = "Write a function to calculate Fibonacci sequence"

predictions = router.predict(query)
# Returns: [('HIGH', 0.92), ('LOW', 0.08)]
# Route to GPT-4 for complex tasks, GPT-3.5 for simple ones
```

### ⚙️ Configuration Optimization

Automatically predict optimal LLM settings (temperature, top\_p) for different query types:

```
config_optimizer = AdaptiveClassifier.from_pretrained("adaptive-classifier/llm-config-optimizer")
query = "Explain quantum physics concepts"

predictions = config_optimizer.predict(query)
# Returns: [('BALANCED', 0.85), ('CREATIVE', 0.10), ...]
# Automatically suggests temperature range: 0.6-1.0 for balanced responses

## Architecture Overview

The Adaptive Classifier combines four key components in a unified architecture:

[![[architecture.png|Adaptive Classifier Architecture]]](https://github.com/codelion/adaptive-classifier/blob/main/docs/images/architecture.png)

1. **Transformer Embeddings**: Uses state-of-the-art language models for text representation
2. **Prototype Memory**: Maintains class prototypes for quick adaptation to new examples
3. **Adaptive Neural Layer**: Learns refined decision boundaries through continuous training
4. **Strategic Classification**: Defends against adversarial manipulation using game-theoretic principles. When strategic mode is enabled, the system:
	- Models potential strategic behavior of users trying to game the classifier
		- Uses cost functions to represent the difficulty of manipulating different features
		- Combines regular predictions with strategic-aware predictions for robustness
		- Provides multiple prediction modes: dual (blended), strategic (simulates manipulation), and robust (anti-manipulation)

## Why Adaptive Classification?

Traditional classification approaches face significant limitations when dealing with evolving requirements and adversarial environments:

[![[comparison.png|Traditional vs Adaptive Classification]]](https://github.com/codelion/adaptive-classifier/blob/main/docs/images/comparison.png)

The Adaptive Classifier overcomes these limitations through:

- **Dynamic class addition** without full retraining
- **Strategic robustness** against adversarial manipulation
- **Memory-efficient prototypes** with FAISS optimization
- **Zero downtime updates** for production systems
- **Game-theoretic defense** mechanisms

## Continuous Learning Process

The system evolves through distinct phases, each building upon previous knowledge without catastrophic forgetting:

[![[continuous-learning-workflow.png|Continuous Learning Workflow]]](https://github.com/codelion/adaptive-classifier/blob/main/docs/images/continuous-learning-workflow.png)

The learning process includes:

- **Initial Training**: Bootstrap with basic classes
- **Dynamic Addition**: Seamlessly add new classes as they emerge
- **Continuous Learning**: Refine decision boundaries with EWC protection
- **Strategic Enhancement**: Develop robustness against manipulation
- **Production Deployment**: Full capability with ongoing adaptation

## Order Dependency in Online Learning

When using the adaptive classifier for true online learning (adding examples incrementally), be aware that the order in which examples are added can affect predictions. This is inherent to incremental neural network training.

### The Challenge

```
# These two scenarios may produce slightly different models:

# Scenario 1
classifier.add_examples(["fish example"], ["aquatic"])
classifier.add_examples(["bird example"], ["aerial"])

# Scenario 2  
classifier.add_examples(["bird example"], ["aerial"])
classifier.add_examples(["fish example"], ["aquatic"])
```

While we've implemented sorted label ID assignment to minimize this effect, the neural network component still learns incrementally, which can lead to order-dependent behavior.

### Solution: Prototype-Only Predictions

For applications requiring strict order independence, you can configure the classifier to rely solely on prototype-based predictions:

```
# Configure to use only prototypes (order-independent)
config = {
    'prototype_weight': 1.0,  # Use only prototypes
    'neural_weight': 0.0      # Disable neural network contribution
}

classifier = AdaptiveClassifier("bert-base-uncased", config=config)
```

With this configuration:

- Predictions are based solely on similarity to class prototypes (mean embeddings)
- Results are completely order-independent
- Trade-off: May have slightly lower accuracy than the hybrid approach

### Best Practices

1. **For maximum consistency**: Use prototype-only configuration
2. **For maximum accuracy**: Accept some order dependency with the default hybrid approach
3. **For production systems**: Consider batching updates and retraining periodically if strict consistency is required
4. **Model selection matters**: Some models (e.g., `google-bert/bert-large-cased`) may produce poor embeddings for single words. For better results with short inputs, consider:
	- `bert-base-uncased`
		- `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
		- Or any model specifically trained for semantic similarity
