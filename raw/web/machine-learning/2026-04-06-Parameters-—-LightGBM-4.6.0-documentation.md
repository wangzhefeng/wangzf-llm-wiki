## Parameters

This page contains descriptions of all parameters in LightGBM.

**List of other helpful links**

## Parameters Format

Parameters are merged together in the following order (later items overwrite earlier ones):

1. LightGBM’s default values
2. special files for `weight`, `init_score`, `query`, and `positions` (see )
3. (CLI only) configuration in a file passed like `config=train.conf`
4. (CLI only) configuration passed via the command line
5. (Python, R) special keyword arguments to some functions (e.g. `num_boost_round` in `train()`)
6. (Python, R) `params` function argument (including `**kwargs` in Python and `...` in R)
7. (C API) `parameters` or `params` function argument

Many parameters have “aliases”, alternative names which refer to the same configuration.

Where a mix of the primary parameter name and aliases are given, the primary parameter name is always preferred to any aliases.

For example, in Python:

```python
# use learning rate of 0.07, because 'learning_rate'
# is the primary parameter name
lgb.train(
   params={
      "learning_rate": 0.07,
      "shrinkage_rate": 0.12
   },
   train_set=dtrain
)
```

Where multiple aliases are given, and the primary parameter name is not, the first alias appearing in the lists returned by `Config::parameter2aliases()` in the C++ library is used. Those lists are hard-coded in a fairly arbitrary way… wherever possible, avoid relying on this behavior.

For example, in Python:

```python
# use learning rate of 0.12, LightGBM has a hard-coded preference for 'shrinkage_rate'
# over any other aliases, and 'learning_rate' is not provided
lgb.train(
   params={
      "eta": 0.19,
      "shrinkage_rate": 0.12
   },
   train_set=dtrain
)
```

**CLI**

The parameters format is `key1=value1 key2=value2 ...`. Parameters can be set both in config file and command line. By using command line, parameters should not have spaces before and after `=`. By using config files, one line can only contain one parameter. You can use `#` to comment.

**Python**

Any parameters that accept multiple values should be passed as a Python list.

```python
params = {
   "monotone_constraints": [-1, 0, 1]
}
```

**R**

Any parameters that accept multiple values should be passed as an R list.

```
params <- list(
   monotone_constraints = c(-1, 0, 1)
)
```

		- number of threads for LightGBM
		- `0` means default number of threads in OpenMP
		- for the best speed, set this to the number of **real CPU cores**, not the number of threads (most CPUs use [hyper-threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading) to generate 2 threads per CPU core)
		- do not set it too large if your dataset is small (for instance, do not use 64 threads for a dataset with 10,000 rows)
		- be aware a task manager or any similar CPU monitoring tool might report that cores not being fully utilized. **This is normal**
		- for distributed learning, do not use all CPU cores because this will cause poor performance for the network communication

- `device_type` [🔗︎](#device_type "Permalink to this parameter"), default = `cpu`, type = enum, options: `cpu`, `gpu`, `cuda`, aliases: `device`
	- device for the tree learning
		- `cpu` supports all LightGBM functionality and is portable across the widest range of operating systems and hardware
		- `cuda` offers faster training than `gpu` or `cpu`, but only works on GPUs supporting CUDA
		- `gpu` can be faster than `cpu` and works on a wider range of GPUs than CUDA
		- **Note**: it is recommended to use the smaller `max_bin` (e.g. 63) to get the better speed up
		- **Note**: for the faster speed, GPU uses 32-bit float point to sum up by default, so this may affect the accuracy for some tasks. You can set `gpu_use_dp=true` to enable 64-bit float point, but it will slow down the training
		- **Note**: refer to [Installation Guide](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Installation-Guide.html) to build LightGBM with GPU or CUDA support
- `seed` [🔗︎](#seed "Permalink to this parameter"), default = `None`, type = int, aliases: `random_seed`, `random_state`
	- this seed is used to generate other seeds, e.g. `data_random_seed`, `feature_fraction_seed`, etc.
		- by default, this seed is unused in favor of default values of other seeds
		- this seed has lower priority in comparison with other seeds, which means that it will be overridden, if you set other seeds explicitly
- `deterministic` [🔗︎](#deterministic "Permalink to this parameter"), default = `false`, type = bool
	- used only with `cpu` device type
		- setting this to `true` should ensure the stable results when using the same data and the same parameters (and different `num_threads`)
		- when you use the different seeds, different LightGBM versions, the binaries compiled by different compilers, or in different systems, the results are expected to be different
		- you can [raise issues](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues) in LightGBM GitHub repo when you meet the unstable results
		- **Note**: setting this to `true` may slow down the training
		- **Note**: to avoid potential instability due to numerical issues, please set `force_col_wise=true` or `force_row_wise=true` when setting `deterministic=true`

## Learning Control Parameters

- `force_col_wise` [🔗︎](#force_col_wise "Permalink to this parameter"), default = `false`, type = bool

		- the number of columns is large, or the total number of bins is large
				- `num_threads` is large, e.g. `> 20`
				- you want to reduce memory cost
		- **Note**: when both `force_col_wise` and `force_row_wise` are `false`, LightGBM will firstly try them both, and then use the faster one. To remove the overhead of testing set the faster one to `true` manually
		- **Note**: this parameter cannot be used at the same time with `force_row_wise`, choose only one of them
- `force_row_wise` [🔗︎](#force_row_wise "Permalink to this parameter"), default = `false`, type = bool
	- used only with `cpu` device type
		- set this to `true` to force row-wise histogram building

				- `num_threads` is relatively small, e.g. `<= 16`
				- you want to use small `bagging_fraction` or `goss` sample strategy to speed up
		- **Note**: setting this to `true` will double the memory cost for Dataset object. If you have not enough memory, you can try setting `force_col_wise=true`
		- **Note**: when both `force_col_wise` and `force_row_wise` are `false`, LightGBM will firstly try them both, and then use the faster one. To remove the overhead of testing set the faster one to `true` manually

		- **Note**: the forced split logic will be ignored, if the split makes gain worse
		- see [this file](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/examples/binary_classification/forced_splits.json) as an example

		- the linear model at each leaf includes all the numerical features in that leaf’s branch
		- the first tree has constant leaf values
		- categorical features are used for splits as normal but are not used in the linear models
		- missing values should not be encoded as `0`. Use `np.nan` for Python, `NA` for the CLI, and `NA`, `NA_real_`, or `NA_integer_` for R
		- it is recommended to rescale data before training so that features have similar mean and standard deviation
		- **Note**: works only with `cpu`, `gpu` device type and `serial` tree learner
		- **Note**: `regression_l1` objective is not supported with linear tree boosting
		- **Note**: setting `linear_tree=true` significantly increases the memory use of LightGBM

## Others

### Continued Training with Input Score

LightGBM supports continued training with initial scores. It uses an additional file to store these initial scores, like the following:

```
0.5
-0.1
0.9
...
```

It means the initial score of the first data row is `0.5`, second is `-0.1`, and so on. The initial score file corresponds with data file line by line, and has per score per line.

If the name of data file is `train.txt`, the initial score file should be named as `train.txt.init` and placed in the same folder as the data file. In this case, LightGBM will auto load initial score file if it exists.

If binary data files exist for raw data file `train.txt`, for example in the name `train.txt.bin`, then the initial score file should be named as `train.txt.bin.init`.

### Weight Data

LightGBM supports weighted training. It uses an additional file to store weight data, like the following:

```
1.0
0.5
0.8
...
```

It means the weight of the first data row is `1.0`, second is `0.5`, and so on. Weights should be non-negative.

The weight file corresponds with data file line by line, and has per weight per line.

And if the name of data file is `train.txt`, the weight file should be named as `train.txt.weight` and placed in the same folder as the data file. In this case, LightGBM will load the weight file automatically if it exists.

Also, you can include weight column in your data file. Please refer to the `weight_column` in above.

### Query Data

For learning to rank, it needs query information for training data.

LightGBM uses an additional file to store query data, like the following:

```
27
18
67
...
```

For wrapper libraries like in Python and R, this information can also be provided as an array-like via the Dataset parameter `group`.

```
[27, 18, 67, ...]
```

For example, if you have a 112-document dataset with `group = [27, 18, 67]`, that means that you have 3 groups, where the first 27 records are in the first group, records 28-45 are in the second group, and records 46-112 are in the third group.

**Note**: data should be ordered by the query.

If the name of data file is `train.txt`, the query file should be named as `train.txt.query` and placed in the same folder as the data file. In this case, LightGBM will load the query file automatically if it exists.

Also, you can include query/group id column in your data file. Please refer to the `group_column` in above.
