## OpenLTM

OpenLTM is an open codebase aiming to provide a pipeline to develop and evaluate large time-series models.

> For deep time series models, we recommend [Time-Series-Library](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library) and this comprehensive [Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13278).

> Try out our out-of-the-box time series foundation models in [Large-Time-Series-Model](https://github.com/thuml/Large-Time-Series-Model) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/thuml/time-series-foundation-models-67c80ace73299239b651d954).

## Updates

🚩 **News** (2025.05) We release 260B pre-trained [Timer in PyTorch](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/01c35ca13f474176be7b/). This version is equivalent to [Huggingface Model](https://huggingface.co/thuml/timer-base-84m), but more user-friendly for fine-tuning. This [notebook](https://github.com/thuml/OpenLTM/blob/main/load_pth_ckpt.ipynb) shows how to load and use the checkpoint.

🚩 **News** (2025.04) Many thanks for the implementation of [TTMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03955) and other LLM4TS methods from [frndtls](https://github.com/frndtls).

🚩 **News** (2024.12) Many thanks for the implementation of [GPT4TS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11939) from [khairulislam](https://github.com/khairulislam).

🚩 **News** (2024.10) We include several large time-series models, release pre-training code, and provide scripts.

## What is LTM?

LTM (**L** arge **T** ime-Series **M** odel, aka Time Series Foundation Model, TSFM) is a deep time series models built on scalable backbones (e.g., Transformers) via large-scale pre-training, which will be applied to a variety of time series data (e.g., zero-shot forecasting) and downstream tasks (e.g., general feature extraction of time series). For more information, here we list some tutorials: [\[CN\]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/7b88e05d38bb40a1be30/), [\[EN\]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/c5fca76d6fa54f1d891a/).

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.11 For convenience, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Place downloaded data in the folder `./dataset`. Here is a [dataset summary](https://github.com/thuml/OpenLTM/blob/main/figures/datasets.png).
- For univariate pre-training (skip this step if you use a pre-trained checkpoint):
	- [UTSD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thuml/UTSD) contains 1 billion time points for large-scale pre-training (in numpy format): [\[Download\]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/93868e3a9fb144fe9719/).
		- [ERA5-Family](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5) (40-year span, thousands of variables) for domain-specific model: [\[Download\]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/7fe0b95032c64d39bc4a/).
- For supervised training or modeling adaptation
	- Datasets from [TSLib](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library): [\[Download\]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/4d83223ad71047e28aec/).
1. Training from scratch or using our pre-trained checkpoint in the folder `./checkpoints`
- We provide the [checkpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04803) pre-trained on 260B time points [\[Download\]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/01c35ca13f474176be7b/).
1. We provide some supervised training, pre-training, and adaptation scripts under the folder `./scripts/`:

```
# Supervised training
# (a) one-for-one forecasting
bash ./scripts/supervised/forecast/moirai_ecl.sh
# (b) one-for-all (rolling) forecasting
bash ./scripts/supervised/rolling_forecast/timer_xl_ecl.sh

# Large-scale pre-training
# (a) pre-training on UTSD
bash ./scripts/pretrain/timer_xl_utsd.sh
# (b) pre-training on ERA5
bash ./scripts/pretrain/timer_xl_era5.sh

# Model adaptation
# (a) full-shot fine-tune
bash ./scripts/adaptation/full_shot/timer_xl_etth1.sh
# (b) few-shot fine-tune
bash ./scripts/adaptation/few_shot/timer_xl_etth1.sh
```

1. Develop your large time-series model.
- Add the model file to the folder `./models`. You can follow the `./models/timer_xl.py`.
- Include the newly added model in the `Exp_Basic.model_dict` of `./exp/exp_basic.py`.
- Create the corresponding scripts under the folder `./scripts`.

> [!note] Note
> LTMs are still small compared to foundation models of other modalities. For example, it is okay to use CPUs for inference, RTX 4090s for adaptation, A100s for pre-training.
